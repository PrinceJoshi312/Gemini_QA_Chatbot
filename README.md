# 🎙️ Gemini Voice-Enabled Q&A Chatbot

This project is a simple yet powerful **voice-controlled chatbot** powered by **Google's Gemini API**. It listens to your spoken queries, fetches intelligent responses from Gemini, and speaks the answers back to you.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎤 Converts voice to text using Google Speech Recognition
- 💬 Asks questions to the Gemini model (2.5 Flash)
- 🗣️ Reads answers aloud using Text-to-Speech
- 🔄 Supports continuous interaction in a loop
- 🛑 Exit with voice command: `exit`, `quit`, or `stop`


## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
````

> 🔊 `pyaudio` may require system-level dependencies. On Ubuntu/Debian, run:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
> ```

## 🚀 Running the Bot

Run the notebook `Gemini_QA_Chatbot.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Once started:

* The bot will prompt you to **speak**.
* It will send your query to Gemini and **read the response** back.
* Say `"exit"` or `"quit"` to end the session.
